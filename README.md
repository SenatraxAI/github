### Applied Artificial Intelligence | Systems & Developer Tooling

Welcome to our open-source lab. We specialize in building the infrastructure for the next generation of intelligent automation—focusing on robustness, transparency, and scalable engineering.

## 🏗️ Our Ecosystem
We categorize our work into three primary layers:

### 1. Autonomous Systems
End-to-end AI applications designed for high-stakes environments.
* **Reasoning Engines:** Systems that move beyond classification to structural logic.
* **Agentic Workflows:** Multi-agent architectures for automated research and task execution.

### 2. Developer Toolkits
Utilities designed to improve the AI development lifecycle.
* **XAI & Interpretability:** Tools for extracting human-readable logic from neural networks.
* **Adversarial Defense:** Frameworks for stress-testing and hardening models against evasion attacks.

### 3. AI Infrastructure
The "plumbing" of our AI systems.
* **Adaptive Computation:** Implementations for dynamic model efficiency (ACT).
* **Quantization & Deployment:** Tooling for optimized inference on edge devices.

## 🛠️ The "Lab Standard"
Every project in this organization adheres to a professional engineering standard:
- **Modular Design:** Code is structured for reusability across different AI domains.
- **Explainability First:** We prioritize models that can explain *why* they made a decision.
- **Production Ready:** All tools include CLI support, environment configs, and unit tests.
